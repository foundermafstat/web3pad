Goal:
Implement and verify a modular smart contract suite for a multi-game launchpad on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity.

Contracts to generate:

contracts/registry.clar — Launchpad Registry for registering and managing:

Game modules

NFT contracts

FT contracts

Trusted off-chain servers

contracts/shooter-game.clar — Example game module (already provided by user)

contracts/nft-trait.clar — SIP-009 interface

contracts/ft-trait.clar — SIP-010 interface

README.md — architecture description

System goals:

Modular, upgradeable, secure foundation for multi-game interaction.

Unified registry connecting NFT/FT assets and games.

On-chain authorization of trusted off-chain game servers.

All contracts verified under Clarity v2.1+.

Verification tasks:

Ensure clarinet check passes for all .clar files.

Verify shooter-game.clar can resolve registry contract address.

Confirm no undefined traits or contract calls.

Output format:

Valid Clarity codebase under /contracts/

README.md with full architecture overview

Optional Clarinet test cases (/tests)

Success Criteria:

No runtime or compile errors.

Fully functional registry with extensibility for new game modules.

Deterministic and auditable behavior.
